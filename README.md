# Pytorch tutorials

- Make it easy for anyone to understand huge libraries by taking small examples and breaking it up in that way
- Tackle all sorts of problems using pure pytorch and not relying on external libraries like Lightning/Fastai etc etc
- End up with boilerplate code for a variety of tasks
- Note that this is work in progress. And many more folders will be added in the coming days

# There are a billion similar repositories, what makes this different?

- Want to understand research papers? Check out my other repo [Link](https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/PaperImplementations/)
- Comments!!
- Standardized (mostly) code. Aka I try to be as uniform in my approach as possible
- Might write a few blog posts

- To be very honest, it is for my practise xD

## Some notes

- No distributed training. I have only one GPU (sad) so I wont be using it
- What is the accuracy? Well run it and find out. I cant train everything to its maximum capacity due to lack of time
- Why so many files? I wonder the same sometimes. But its easier to modify for other data. And keeps my errors easily identifiable
